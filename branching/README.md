# Branching

Branching is one of the most powerful features of Git.
It allows developers to work on different features or fixes **independently** without affecting the main codebase.

Branches make collaboration, experimentation, and safe development possible.

## What You Will Learn

- What branches are and why they are used
- How to create and list branches
- How to switch between branches
- How to merge branches
- What merge conflicts are and why they occur

## Key Concepts

- **Branch**
  A branch is an independent line of development.
  Each branch has its own commit history.

- **main (or master)**
  The primary branch that contains stable production-ready code.

- **Feature Branch**
  A separate branch created to develop a specific feature or fix.

- **Merge**
  The process of combining changes from one branch into another.

## Why Branching is Important

- Enables parallel development
- Prevents breaking stable code
- Makes collaboration easier
- Helps maintain a clean project history

## Commands Covered

- `git branch`
- `git checkout`
- `git merge`

## Recommended Workflow

1. Create a new branch for a feature
2. Switch to the new branch
3. Make and commit changes
4. Switch back to the main branch
5. Merge the feature branch into main
