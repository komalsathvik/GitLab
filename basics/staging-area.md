# Staging Area

## Description

The staging area is an intermediate step between your working directory and commits.

## Git Workflow

Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository

## Why Staging Exists

- Allows selective commits
- Prevents accidental commits
- Helps create clean commit history

## Key Idea

Only files in the staging area get committed.
